# CAESAR CIPHER PROGRAM

## Encrypt and Decrypt Text Using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm

---

This is my first task assigned as part of my internship at Skill Craft Technology.This task involves creating a program that demonstrates the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a classic encryption technique. The project includes the following components:

- Create a program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption
- Write functions to handle the encryption and decryption processes based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Ensure the program outputs the encrypted or decrypted message clearly and accurately based on user input.

## Installation & Usage
...
Ensure you have Python installed.

1.Clone this repository
2.Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3.Run the program
4.Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
5.Follow the instructions to input your message and shift value.

## Example
...
- Type `encrypt` for Encryption and `decrypt` for Decryption
- For Encryption:
  - Enter the message: `HELLO`
  - Enter the shift value: `3`
  - The encrypted message is: `KHOOR`
- For Decryption:
  - Enter the message: `KHOOR`
  - Enter the shift value: `3`
  - The decrypted message is: `HELLO`
- Type `yes` to continue and `no` to stop
